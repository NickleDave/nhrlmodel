Setup
=====

This code relies on Nengo version 1.4, which can be downloaded `here <http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca:8080/jenkins/job/Nengo/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nengo-latest.zip>`_.  Extract Nengo into a location of your choice, which we will call ``<nengo>``.

Then check out this repository into a different folder ``<nhrl>`` via

.. code-block:: bash

    cd nhrl
    git clone https://github.com/drasmuss/nhrlmodel.git

The model can then be run through Nengo:

.. code-block:: bash

    <nengo>/nengo-cl <nhrl>/hrlproject/misc/run.py delivery

where ``delivery`` can be swapped for various keywords to run the model in different environments (see ``run.py``).

Note
====

The model is written in Python, and uses Jython to interact with the Java-based Nengo 1.4.  Hence the code style is a bit of a mix of Java and Python conventions depending on where the code originated, which the reader will have to pardon.
